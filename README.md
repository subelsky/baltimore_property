Baltimore Property Scraper
==========================
I used this code to scrape three databases for information about non-owner
occupied property in Baltimore, in hopes of identifying entities which own a
large number of vacant properties. Check out http://subelsky.com for a full
explanation and important caveats.

I was inspired by the work at [Baltimore Slumlord
Watch](http://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/), and [Kate
Bladow](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kbladow) suggested I tackle this project.

Data
====
All of the data have been published to https://github.com/subelsky/baltimore_property/downloads.
I recommend you work with `refined_non_owner_occupied_properties.csv.gz` if you
need the raw data.

If you'd like to do further refinement you can use the `google_refine_baltimore_non_owner_occupied_properties.tar.gz` file.

If you'd prefer to do your own refining then `baltimore_nonowner_occupied_properties.csv.gz` is there for you!
