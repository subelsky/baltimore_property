Baltimore Property Scraper
==========================
I used this code to scrape three databases for information about non-owner
occupied property in Baltimore, in hopes of identifying entities which own a
large number of vacant properties. Check out http://subelsky.com for a full
explanation and important caveats.

I was inspired by the work at [Baltimore Slumlord
Watch](http://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/), and [Kate
Bladow](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kbladow) suggested I tackle this project.

Data
====
All of the data have been published to https://github.com/subelsky/baltimore_property/downloads.
If you'd like to explore the data on your own I recommend loading `non_owner_occupied_properties.tsv.gz`
into [Google Refine](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/).
