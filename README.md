Baltimore Property Scraper
==========================
I used this code to scrape three databases for information about non-owner
occupied property in Baltimore, in hopes of identifying entities which own a
large number of vacant properties. Check out http://subelsky.com for a full
explanation and important caveats.

I was inspired by the work at [Baltimore Slumlord
Watch](http://slumlordwatch.wordpress.com/), and [Kate
Bladow](http://www.linkedin.com/in/kbladow) suggested I tackle this project.

Data
====
The raw data is in the `data` directory. One file is CSV formatted and contains
the results of running these scripts. The other is a Google Refine project which
contains several important transformations and cleanups of the raw CSV.
